# Electric-Field-Simulator
This simulator will show the electric filed lines of a given electro-static system of charges.

To see an electric filed lines, the user have to set some charges in space. There are 3 kinds:
1. Positive charge - presented as a red circle with a plus sign on it. To add it, the user needs to press P or p on keyboard.
2. Negative charge - presented as a blue circle with a minus sign on it. To add it, the user needs to press N or n on keyboard.
3. Test charge - presented as a yellow circle with a t letter on it. It is actually a positive charge, but doesn't affect the electric field. By putting it in space, the user can see the electric force vector applied on it (includes direction and power). To add it, the user needs to press T or t on keyboard.

A general note: Either the user will put positive, negative or test charge. The charge initial position will always be in the ceneter of the screen and to change the charge location the user have to click on the specific charge, move the mouse to the new location and press enter to release the charge there.
