To see an electric field lines, the user have to set some charges in space. There are 3 kinds:
1. Positive charge - presented as a red circle with a plus sign on it. To add it, the user needs to press P or p on keyboard.
2. Negative charge - presented as a blue circle with a minus sign on it. To add it, the user needs to press N or n on keyboard.
3. Test charge - presented as a yellow circle with a t letter on it. It is actually a positive charge, but doesn't affect the electric field. By putting it in space, the user can see the electric force vector applied on it (includes direction and power). To add it, the user needs to press T or t on keyboard.
